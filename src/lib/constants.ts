  {
    question: "Does it sound human?",

      "Yes. Our voice agents use advanced conversational AI with natural pacing, pauses, and industry-specific vocabulary. Most callers don't realize they're speaking with AI. We customize the voice, tone, and greeting to match your brand.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it book appointments?",

      "Absolutely. Voxora integrates with Google Calendar, Calendly, Dentrix, and most practice management systems. The AI checks real-time availability and books appointments during the call, then sends SMS confirmations automatically.",

  {
    question: "Can it transfer calls?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You define transfer rules — urgent matters go to your on-call team, specific departments get routed correctly, and the AI provides context to the receiving person before connecting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it answer after hours?",
    answer:
      "This is one of our core strengths. Your AI receptionist works 24/7/365 — nights, weekends, and holidays. After-hours callers get the same quality experience as during business hours, with full booking capability.",

    question: "How long does setup take?",

      "Most businesses go live within 5–7 business days. We handle agent training, integration setup, and testing. Enterprise deployments with custom integrations typically take 2–3 weeks.",
